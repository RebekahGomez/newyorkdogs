# NEW YORK DOGS

- This is a personal project I've wanted to work on for a while. I moved to New York in June 2023, and one of my good friends from Wisconsin LOVES dogs. When I told her I was moving, she was so excited for me and exclaimed, "You are you going to see SO many dogs!"
- And she was right. I have seen SO many dogs. Initially I would text her photos of the dogs I took photos of every week, but why not share all these good girls & boys with everyone?
- Hence this website. I plan to update it periodically as I take more photos around town.
